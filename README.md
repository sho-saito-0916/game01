## This game was created by me in a univercity class. 
### I will write below how to play

1. This game is played by two people, and you decide who will go first and who will follow.
2. If you click on an empty space, your symbol will be written on it, and if you click on one, you will switch places with your opponent.
3. Repeat this process. The winner is the first person to line up the same symbols vertically, horizontally, or diagonally in a straight line.
